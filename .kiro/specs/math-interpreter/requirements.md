# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the Interpreter Pattern in Python to create a mathematical expression evaluator. The system will be capable of parsing and computing mathematical terms using constants, variables, and basic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication). The interpreter will provide a flexible architecture that can be easily extended with additional operators and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to evaluate mathematical expressions with constants, so that I can perform basic arithmetic calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a constant value is provided THEN the system SHALL return the exact numeric value
2. WHEN multiple constants are used in an expression THEN the system SHALL maintain their individual values accurately
3. IF a constant is a floating-point number THEN the system SHALL preserve decimal precision

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use variables in mathematical expressions, so that I can create dynamic calculations with substitutable values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable is defined with a name and value THEN the system SHALL store and retrieve the variable correctly
2. WHEN a variable is used in an expression THEN the system SHALL substitute its current value
3. IF a variable is undefined THEN the system SHALL raise an appropriate error
4. WHEN a variable value is updated THEN subsequent evaluations SHALL use the new value

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform addition operations, so that I can combine numeric values and variables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two constants are added THEN the system SHALL return their mathematical sum
2. WHEN variables are added THEN the system SHALL evaluate each variable and sum the results
3. WHEN constants and variables are mixed in addition THEN the system SHALL evaluate correctly
4. WHEN multiple addition operations are chained THEN the system SHALL evaluate left-to-right

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform multiplication operations, so that I can calculate products of numeric values and variables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two constants are multiplied THEN the system SHALL return their mathematical product
2. WHEN variables are multiplied THEN the system SHALL evaluate each variable and multiply the results
3. WHEN constants and variables are mixed in multiplication THEN the system SHALL evaluate correctly
4. WHEN multiple multiplication operations are chained THEN the system SHALL evaluate left-to-right

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to combine addition and multiplication in complex expressions, so that I can create sophisticated mathematical calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an expression contains both addition and multiplication THEN the system SHALL follow standard mathematical precedence (multiplication before addition)
2. WHEN parentheses are used THEN the system SHALL evaluate grouped expressions first
3. WHEN nested operations occur THEN the system SHALL evaluate from innermost to outermost
4. WHEN complex expressions are evaluated THEN the system SHALL return mathematically correct results

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean interpreter pattern implementation, so that the system is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interpreter is designed THEN it SHALL follow the classic Interpreter Pattern structure
2. WHEN new operators need to be added THEN the system SHALL support extension without modifying existing code
3. WHEN expressions are parsed THEN the system SHALL create an abstract syntax tree representation
4. WHEN expressions are evaluated THEN the system SHALL traverse the syntax tree appropriately
5. IF invalid expressions are provided THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
